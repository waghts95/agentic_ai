The Consumer Price Index for all items increased by 0.3% in June 2025 , on a seasonally adjusted basis, as reported by the U.S. The annual inflation rate for the United States was 2.9% for the 12 months ending August, compared to 2.7% previously, according to U.S. Labor Department data published on September 11, 2025 .

Prices for all items less food and energy rose 3.1 percent, food prices increased 3.2 percent, and energy prices increased 0.2 percent since August 2024. Forecasters expect inflation to continue rising in the fourth quarter as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to push up prices for everyday goods and services.

      "To calculate the inflation increase from 2024 to 2025, we were given that in 2024, the inflation rate was 3.2%. The difference between the two rates is 0.3%, so the inflation increased by approximately 0.3% from 2024 to 2025.\n",
